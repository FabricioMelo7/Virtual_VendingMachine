Virtual Vending Machine using WPF(MVVM), simulating the operations of ordering and dispensing of a real vending machine.
The aim is to explore WPF XAML, MVVM, Non-Relational database(XML file) and functional logic. 
This project can be expanded to include more features and other fixes later on, it will be a good playground for me to keep improving my current C# & WPF skills
Anyone can grab this and do whatever they like to it, or give suggestion for me to try out
